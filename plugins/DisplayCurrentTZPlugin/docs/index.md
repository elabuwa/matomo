# Welcome!

Welcome to the DisplayCurrentTZ Plugin.
This plugin attempts to provide the user with a widget that can be added to the dashboard which will display the current site time and the current user time.
The current user time is only displayed if the current site time does not match the user's time.


# Files

Widget is rendered through the displayCurrentTime.twig file file.
Minified js file is set to render the times.
However, the source is also available in the javascripts folder in the plugin directory.
